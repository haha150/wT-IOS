# wTesla-IOS

This project is a standalone Tesla app for the Apple watch with all the features that the official Tesla app has.

The main purpose for creating this app is to essentially make the competitor "Watch app for Tesla" obsolete. To be honest, the competitor is scamming people out of $11.99 and personally i dont like this kind of behaviour. Link to competitor for reference: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/watch-app-for-tesla/id1512108917

With that being said, i am at a point where i am considering publishing it to the app store either for free or $1 or $2.

The app is still being developed to finish implementing all features that the official Tesla app has as well as the competitor has.
